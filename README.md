# drinker_project
Classification project based on a kaggle dataset containing data about drinking habits and other parameters

The aim is to understand if it is possibile to define a relation between a target value (drinker status: "N", "Y") and some predictors both qualitative (i.e. smoker status) and quantitative (blood pressure, body index mass, cholesterol, etc).
